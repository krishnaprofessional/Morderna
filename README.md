# Morderna

-> Morderna is a web application using React.Js and Redux. 
   The whole idea is use to create the exact replica of the original web Page.

-> Api url is used to fetch the data from the given source.
   Due to cross platform isssues I used proxy to fetch the data.

-> CSS and Bootstrap$ are used for styling this web Application.

-> Webpack is used for module bundler.

Configuration:

1. npm install (to install all the dependencies).

2. npm run proxy ( to run the proxy).

3. Open new Tab in Terminal/ Command prompt.

4. npm start (to run the application ).

5. Point 2,4 should be run in parllel to start the application.

6. It automatically opens the local-host:3002 where you can see the application.

Note:

-> Dont forget to Refresh the application when it opens in local-host: 3002

->  Moderna requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run (to run the proxy).
